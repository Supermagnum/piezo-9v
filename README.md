# piezo-9v
A small PCB for pizoelectric amplifier, runs on 9V.
It should have battery capacity for around 5 hours.

It's fairly easy and straight forward to solder the components to the circuit board, a nice pointy soldering iron, solder, a magnifying glass, and a ohm or multimeter is all that is needed. 
Of course one needs a suitable metal box, and the circuit boards components must not come in contact with the metal box. 
That will cause short circuit, so it's best mounted on conducting stand offs because the corner pads on the PCB board must be connected to the metal box.
Also, use the magnifying glass to check that no one of the soldering pads has been bridged.

A shielded cable must be used to connect to the piezoelectric element.
It must have a braided shield and two conductors. 
Digi-Key Part Number 2389-CF891-05-02-ND is OK.
	

It can be used for a reverb plate, listening to the insides of a engine,recording the sound of vibrating things. 
You will need one piezoelectric disk for that, mounted in a metal box made of thin metal. Non electric conductive super glue is useable for that. Just glue it to a flat surface. 
The piezoelectric disk should be electrically insulated from the metal box.

Around 40 dB gain should be nice for hydrophone usage.
